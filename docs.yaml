description: A demonstration of connecting MongoDB Atlas from a subgraph and
  making the data available via the router. The repo demonstrates how you can
  expose and pass down a MongoDB-like filter for filtering returned data, as
  well as, a more demand-driven approach of using specific GraphQL arguments.
